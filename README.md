# Password Generator

## Description

This password generator is an application that can take user input options to generate a random string for a password.
The user options include:
* Length of password (between 8 and 128 characters) 
* Types of characters to be included in password 
    * lowercase letters (abc...)
    * uppercase letters (ABC...)
    * numerical characters (123...)
    * special character (!?-...)

At lease one character type must be chosen.

This password generator could be used to generate a password that, depending on user options, would be very secure.

## Installation

On loading the application, there are a series of prompts to take the user options for the password.

* Firstly the user can choose a password length by entering a number. If the user chooses a password length that is too short or too long, they are alerted to this and are asked again to enter a desired password length.
* Next a series of confirm boxes let the user choose one at a time which character types the user wants in the password by clicking okay for yes or cancel for no. If the user selects cancel for all character types they are asked to select at least one and are offered the options again.
* Finally this the user can click the 'Generate Password' button to make the password appear on the screen. This password can be copied and pasted to use.

If the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button again it will generate a different password with the same parameters set by the user i.e. length and character types.

To generate a password with new options the user can refresh the page to reload the prompts to choose options, and will see the new options in effect when they click the 'Generate Password' button.

## What I learned

When building this app I was able to practise using functions, loops, if/else statements as well as array methods. 

If I were to build this app again I would like to be more confident using other array methods, such as forEach instead of for loop.
